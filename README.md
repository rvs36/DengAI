# DengAI

Took part in the DengAI predictive modelling competition with an objective to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more.  

I used [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) for making the **time-series based predictions** 

Prior to that, build the understanding of the data using corelation heatmaps between the variables, bar and pie charts etc.  
I also tried using the linear regularized regression ([Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization)) to predict the cases. 

As of 1st April 2020, my predictions were in the **92nd percentile** of all the submissions.
